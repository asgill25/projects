Ingredients
   
125g butter, softened
100g light brown soft sugar
125g caster sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract
225g self-raising flour
0.5 tsp salt
200g chocolate chips
     
Method
          
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C, gas mark 4
Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.
Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.
Roll into walnut size balls, for a more homemade look, or roll into a long, thick sausage shape and slice to make neater looking cookies.
Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for just 7 minutes, till the cookies are just setting - the cookies will be really doughy and delicious.
Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they dont all get eaten straight away!
